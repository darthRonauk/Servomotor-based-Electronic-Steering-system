# Servomotor-based-Electronic-Steering-system
In Olden Days Steering Mechanisms Developed To Turn A Vehicle At A Certain Radius While Negotiating A Turn Had A Greater Steering Gear Ratio. For A Small Rotation Of The Steering Gear The Steering Wheel Had To Be Given A Greater Effort For Larger Degree Of Rotation Than That Of The Steering Gear Inorder To Develop Torque For Turning The Vehicle. To Reduce The Effort At The Steering Wheel, Power Steering Was Developed In The 18th Century. It Not Only Made Steering Easier But Also Increased The Accuracy In Steering A Four Wheeled Vehicle. Precision Turning In Four Wheeled Vehicles Not Only Prevents The Vehicle From Skidding But Also Prevents Road Accidents. Various Other Mechanisms Were Also Established For Reducing The Steering Effort And Precision Turning Including Hydraulics As Well As Electronic Type. Taking Into Account The Various Systems Of Steering As Well As Using A Bit Of Electronics And Microcontroller Application A Modern Technique Can Be Developed Using A Servomotor, An Accelerometer And A Microprocessor For An Increased Precision In Steering Of A Vehicle Which May Be Termed As The “Accelerometer Driven Servomotor Based Steering Gear” Or “A.S. Steering Gear”. In This Paper, I Shall Discuss How To Use An Accelerometer To Control A Servomotor Inorder To Help In Steering Of A Vehicle By Means Of Basic Microcontroller Applications And Programming.
